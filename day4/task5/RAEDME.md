**Overview of the Stopwatch Project:**

This is a simple stopwatch application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer, displaying the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

- The stopwatch starts counting when the "Start" button is clicked.
- It stops when the "Stop" button is pressed.
- It resets to 00:00:00 upon clicking the "Reset" button.
