**Simple Node.js HTTP Server**

This is a basic Node.js server using the built-in http module. The server listens on port 4000 and serves different responses based on the request URL.

- Serves a Home Page, About Page, and Contact Page.
- Returns a 404 Page Not Found for unknown routes.
- Uses http.createServer() to handle incoming requests.
