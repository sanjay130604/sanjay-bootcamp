## Overview
The StudentLis` and StudentCard components are designed to display student information in a styled card format. In this updated version, the StudentCard dynamically changes its background color based on the student's year. For example, Freshmen have a green background, Sophomores have yellow, Juniors have blue, and Seniors have red. This makes the student cards visually distinct based on their academic year.
