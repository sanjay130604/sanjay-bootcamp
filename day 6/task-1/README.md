### Overview for README.md:

This project sets up a basic Express.js server with a simple route to handle GET requests. When the user visits the root URL (`/`), the server responds with a JSON message saying "Hello World." This server is designed to run locally on port 3000.

 
   To get the server up and running, simply clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the server with Node.js. The server will be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`. 
   - **server.js**: Contains the Express server setup and the route for returning a "Hello World" message.  
   - **Dependencies**: The project relies on Express to handle HTTP requests and responses.
