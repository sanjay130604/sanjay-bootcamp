- The application provides a GET route at /users, which returns an array of user objects in JSON format, allowing clients to easily retrieve a list of users.
- The application is built using the Express framework, which simplifies routing and handling HTTP requests in a Node.js environment. The server listens on port 3000 and logs a message when successfully started.
